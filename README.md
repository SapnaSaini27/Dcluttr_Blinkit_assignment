Blinkit City Insights â€“ SQL-Based Inventory and Sales Estimation

This project showcases advanced SQL techniques to create a derived table, blinkit_city_insights, from raw Blinkit product listing data. The objective is to estimate product-level sales performance across cities by analyzing inventory changes over time.

Key Features:

Developed entirely in MySQL using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions

Estimated est_qty_sold by calculating inventory differences between time intervals

Aggregated sales metrics (est_sales_sp, est_sales_mrp) at the SKU and city level

Computed on-shelf availability metrics (wt_osa, wt_osa_ls)

Fully ATS-optimized SQL script with export-ready output in CSV format

Tech Stack:
MySQL, MySQL Workbench, CSV data processing

Skills Demonstrated:

Data wrangling and transformation using SQL

Inventory-based sales estimation logic

Advanced joins and aggregation techniques

Use of window functions such as ROW_NUMBER

Scalable and performance-optimized query design
